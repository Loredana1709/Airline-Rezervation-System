✈️ Airline Reservation System

-----Final project of Wantsome Java course-----

This java project was based on creating a web application of airline ticket reservation system. The system includes mainly two different accessibility levels. One for Customer's ticket reservation and other for Admin. 

Customers can mainly do booking flights based on different dates and times. After the reservation has been made, they can check it (along with all the previous reservations made).

As an Admin, he can manage all the flights (add, delete, edit), he can do any change he wants to the system database through his interfaces.
